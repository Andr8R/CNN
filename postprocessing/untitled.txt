Electron softmax distribution from the first plot and 

Need very pure samples of muons and very pure sample of electron


if p(electron) > some given p(electron):

else if p(mu) > some given p(mu):

else:

e-gamma separation (

    highlight the overlap
    
    
Add 10^-12

Electron vs gamma
Electron vs Muon
Gamma vs Muon
Muon vs Electron

-- Steps

1. Plot p(e) for different kinds of true events


2. Test the model loader
